SECURITY DISCLAIMER
-----
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! Use at your own risk! This is a proof-of-concept project with known security issues. This project needs a major refactoring in order to be more secure and ready for production use. I am slowly fixing and updating as I get free time to do so. Please, please, please... Do not use this in production, yet! This disclaimer will remain here until the refactoring is complete with security in mind. However, If you don't care... or if you're running this behind a firewall, you should be good to go.

Idea
-----
Keep track of all incoming and outgoing calls in realtime
Watch users that join and leave conference bridges in realtime
Realtime stats (how long average calls take, busy times of the day, etc)
...and more
